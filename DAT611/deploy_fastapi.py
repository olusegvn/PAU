## Defining the Predict Endpoint
# The `@app.post("/predict")` decorator defines a POST endpoint accessible at the URL `/predict`.
# The `predict` function takes one parameter `sample_data` which is automatically validated against the `SampleData` model.
# Inside the function:
# The code attempts to extract the "data" from `sample_data`.
# It converts this data into a pandas DataFrame. If the input is a single dictionary, it is wrapped in a list.
# If any error occurs during the conversion, an HTTPException is raised with a 400 status code and an error message.

        # Convert input data to a DataFrame

    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Invalid input data: {e}")

    # Running the Predictions
    # A new dictionary `predictions` is created to store outputs from each model.
    # The code loops through each loaded model in the `models` dictionary:
    # It calls the `predict` method of each model using the DataFrame.
    # The resulting predictions (typically a numpy array) are converted to a list and stored under the corresponding model name.
    # Finally, the predictions are returned as JSON.
